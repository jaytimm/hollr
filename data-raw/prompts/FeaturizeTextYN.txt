Role
As a political researcher for a think tank, your task is to analyze and categorize abstracts related to political ideology in America. You will answer five yes/no questions for each abstract to identify key themes and methodological aspects. This structured representation will help the think tank understand trends and insights in political behavior, guiding policy recommendations.

Task
Features to Identify:

pol_ideo: Does the abstract mention political ideology or its influence on behaviors or beliefs?
survey_long: Is the research based on survey data collection or involves longitudinal data (multiple waves of data collection)?
demo_geo: Does the abstract include an analysis of demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, education) or mention geographic/regional differences within the United States?
health_policy: Is the study related to public health issues, or does it address implications for policymakers or public health interventions?
misinfo_media_trust: Does the abstract discuss misinformation, media impact, or trust in government/public institutions?



Example Input:

"Personal similarities to a transgressor makes one view the transgression as less immoral. We investigated whether personal relevance might also affect the perceived immorality of politically-charged threats. We hypothesized that increasing the personal relevance of a threat would lead participants to report the threat as more immoral, even for threats the participant might otherwise view indifferently. U.S. participants recruited online (N = 488) were randomly assigned to write about the personal relevance of either a liberal threat (pollution), conservative threat (disrespecting an elder), neutral threat (romantic infidelity), or given a control filler task. Participants then rated how immoral and personally relevant each political threat was, as well as reported their political ideology. Partial support for our hypothesis emerged: when primed with conservative writing prompts, liberal-leaning participants rated the conservative threat as more immoral, compared with the same threat after a liberal writing prompt. We did not find these results for conservative-leaning participants, perhaps because all participants cared relatively equally about the liberal threat."



Expected Output:

{
  "pol_ideo": true,
